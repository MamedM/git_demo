Put your heart and your soul in the suit case
Get out of the city life, get out of your place
Heading to the mountain, heading to the sea
Live your life, be free
Lower your car window, let the wind blow in
Allow sunlight to come in and touch your skin
Smell the scent of dirt listen to the birds singing
Watch those pine trees dancing
This is the vacation time
Time to slow down your life
Time to take a rest and relax
Time to run away from painful fact
This is the vacation time
Feel the grassland beneath your feet
Lay your body down and roll your weed
Try to get stone among the wind breeze
Heaven is the place that we will meet
This is the vacation time
Time to slow down your life
Time to take a rest and relax
Time to run away from painful fact
This is the vacation time
This is the vacation time
